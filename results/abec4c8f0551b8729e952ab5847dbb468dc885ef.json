Exchange reactions, often represented as\n    'R_EX_', can operate in the negative (uptake) direction or positive\n    (secretion) direction. By convention, a negative flux through an exchange\n    reaction represents uptake of the corresponding metabolite, and a positive\n    flux represent discharge.'

This test reports how many\nof these reactions, which transports metabolites from one compartment\nto another, are present in the model, as at least one transport reaction\nmust be present for cells to take up nutrients and/or excrete waste.\n\nA transport reaction is defined as follows:\n1. It contains metabolites from at least 2 compartments and\n2. at least 1 metabolite undergoes no chemical reaction, i.e.,\nthe formula and/or annotation stays the same on both sides of the equation.\n\nA notable exception is transport via PTS, which also contains the following\nrestriction:\n3. The transported metabolite(s) are transported into a compartment through\nthe exchange of a phosphate.\n\nAn example of transport via PTS would be\npep(c) + glucose(e) -> glucose-6-phosphate(c) + pyr(c)\n\nReactions similar to transport via PTS (referred to as \"modified transport\nreactions\") follow a similar pattern:\nA(x) + B-R(y) -> A-R(y) + B(y)\n\nSuch modified transport reactions can be detected, but only when the\nformula is defined for all metabolites in a particular reaction. If this\nis not the case, transport reactions are identified through annotations,\nwhich cannot detect modified transport reactions.",

      "summary": "Specific database cross-references are paramount to mapping information.\nTo provide references to as many databases as possible helps to make the\nmetabolic model more accessible to other researchers. This does not only\nfacilitate the use of a model in a broad array of computational pipelines,\nit also promotes the metabolic model itself to become an organism-specific\nknowledge base.\n\nFor this test to pass, each gene annotation should contain\ncross-references to a number of databases. The currently selection is\nlisted in `annotation.py`, but an ongoing discussion can be found at\nhttps://github.com/opencobra/memote/issues/332. For each database this\ntest checks for the presence of its corresponding namespace ID to comply\nwith the MIRIAM guidelines i.e. they have to match those defined on\nhttps://identifiers.org/.\n\nSince each database is quite different and some potentially incomplete, it\nmay not be feasible to achieve 100% coverage for each of them. Generally\nit should be possible, however, to obtain cross-references to at least\none of the databases for all gene products consistently.",
